            All those things should <em>never be sent directly via e-mail or SMS</em>!
            These communication channels are insecure because messages are not encrypted by default.
            A malicious user can easily gain access to your messages and steal secret or valuable information.

         |
           There are ways to secure those communication channels
           like #{link_to 'PGP', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy', title: 'PGP - Pretty Good Privacy is used to encrypt e-mail messages by using public and private key-pairs.'} for e-mail,
           but most of them are far from trivial to use and understand.

            Burn-Notice relies on the simple principle of a shared secret, a security question that only sender and recipient know about.
            We do not store the answer in our database, it's just used as a password during the encryption process.
            This makes it impossible to access the Burn-Notice unless you know the correct password to decrypt it.

            Following the <em>burn after reading</em> approach, a Burn-Notice will get deleted immediately after it has been read,
            making it impossible for a 3rd party to gain access to the information after the fact.

        p Your message is encrypted with a security question that you choose while creating a new Burn-Notice.
        p Only people knowing the exact answer to this question are able to read your information.
        p This way you have full control over the level of security of your information by choosing an arbitrary hard to guess question.

        p Our product is designed to hold minimal user information, the only thing that you need to use the service is a valid e-mail address.
        p We are not going to share any of your information with a 3rd party!

        ul
          li <em>burn after reading</em>, delete a Burn-Notice immediately after reading
          li <em>burn after time</em>, delete a Burn-Notice when a period of time has elapsed
          li <em>burn after openings</em>, delete a Burn-Notice after a certain amount of access
